            Inspired in the ways of the medieval Knights Templar, the CTemplar mail was created to provide an anonymous
            and end-to-end encrypted mail to anyone who needs their communications shielded from prying eyes. We at
            CTemplar recognize the value in cryptography and cryptocurrency, hence the name “CTemplar” or “Crypto
            Templar.”
