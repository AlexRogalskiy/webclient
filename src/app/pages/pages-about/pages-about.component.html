      <p>As the government continues to function completely outside the realm of accountability, all of us—reporter, missionary, student, businessperson, citizen—become one person, in need of privacy and protection.</p>
      <b>Why I started CTemplar</b>
      <p>The idea to create this service first began when I heard about the atrocities happening in the Middle East, to the innocents and to humanity. Looking around, it would seem the larger world was too busy to pay much attention, distracted by their own affairs or helpless to offer assistance.</p>
      <p>As just one man with limited capabilities, what could I do? Months went by as I pondered this question, finally realizing I must use my own strengths to wage a larger fight against the oppression I see in the world. As a result, I turned to technology—something I know and understand—to create a system of communication so strong and resilient I would trust it with my own life.</p>
      <p>Through this effort to protect communications through encryption, an entirely new service has emerged, one that will never sell out to corporate investors or be weakened by international agendas— CTemplar.</p>
      <b>Why “CTemplar”?</b>
      <p>Nearly a thousand years ago there was a group of men known as the Knights Templar. They protected the wandering pilgrims who wanted nothing more than to visit the Holy Land and find a way to achieve spirituality.</p>
      <p>The Templar safeguarded travelers’ paths by monitoring the roadways and helping them find a successful journey. The Templar stood for righteousness, willing to lay down their lives for the poor and the weak, even if it led to their death.</p>
      <p>Today, there are many people in the world still suffering from this same fear once felt by the innocents, as they look for ways to live their lives in peace and without intrusion. Perhaps you are one of them. I believe we now find ourselves in need of a new Templar, one that can deliver protection against the ongoing invasion of our personal lives.</p>
      <p>Little by little, your privacy is being stolen away—as is mine—and the time is now to reclaim our rights, our freedoms, our anonymity, and to remember the strength of those who came before us, ready and willing to wield a weapon in their own defense. And for us, for modern society, that tool is technology.</p>
