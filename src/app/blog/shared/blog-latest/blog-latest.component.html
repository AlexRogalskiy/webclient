                              <p>We have some great news to share. Several months ago, we were asked to come to
                                  TED Global to give a talk about privacy â€“ and today the video is finally
                                  getting published! It was a great opportunity for us to talk about why privacy
                                  matters and showcase the end-to-end encryption technology we use in CTemplar
                                  to protect your data.</p>

                              <p>This week, it was revealed that as a result of a secret US government directive,
                                  Yahoo was forced to implement special surveillance software to scan all Yahoo
                                  Mail accounts at the request of the NSA and FBI. Sometime in early 2015,
                                  Yahoo secretly modified their spam and malware filters to scan all incoming
                                  email messages.</p>
