                    <p>It is now possible to pay for premium ProtonMail secure email account using Bitcoin. We have designed
                      the payment system to work seamlessly so that Bitcoin payments are automatically converted to ProtonMail
                      credits which can be used to pay for upgrades, pay invoices, or top up your account. This feature was
                      long overdue, so we are glad to finally introduce this.
                      <br/>
                      <br/> Long time followers of CTemplar will know that we actually have a deep connection with Bitcoin, going
                      all the way back to the very beginning of CTemplar’s story. We have always been quite interested in
                      cryptocurrencies and blockchain, as they empower the same principles that inspired us to create CTemplar.</p>

                  about privacy – and today the video is finally getting published! It was a great opportunity for us to
                  talk about why privacy matters and showcase the end-to-end encryption technology we use in CTemplar to

                <p>This week, it was revealed that as a result of a secret US government directive, Yahoo was forced to implement
                  special surveillance software to scan all Yahoo Mail accounts at the request of the NSA and FBI. Sometime
                  in early 2015, Yahoo secretly modified their spam and malware filters to scan all incoming email messages.</p>

                <p>The number of phishing attacks is increasing because they are both easy to execute and highly effective.
                  Even if the eventual goal of an attacker is an organization, attacks always begin by targeting individuals.
                  Phishing attacks have been utilized to steal confidential information, compromise entire organizations,
                  and perhaps even influence a Presidential election.</p>
