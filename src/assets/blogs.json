      "text": "The battle between Iceland and Switzerland over the most secure location to store private users data has been over for several years.   Currently Swiss privacy laws are arguably some of the worst in the world.    While Iceland has risen as one of the most premiere locations  CTemplar chose to locate their servers in Iceland in order for our users to benefit from Icelandic data protection"

      "text": "Protection was created by the CTemplar team after seeing other email services knowingly offer vulnerable services under the illusion of complete security.   For example, they may provide good encryption, but they have access to your username and password and can legally be required to turn them over without your knowledge or consent.  The 4 walls of protection include \"Company Protection, Encryption Protection, Legal Protection, and Technology Protection\"."

      "text": "It would seem the Orwellian prophecies were right—the big brother of our own nation now can spy on anyone, at any time. The notion of privacy has been whittled away to nothing more than a splinter, able to be broken with very little effort. There are those of us who understand the magnitude of this shift and how it will likely affect the future. We can see the truth behind the deception and, despite the temptation, refuse to avert our eyes from what’s happening."
