For example, they may provide good encryption, but they have access to your username and password and can legally be required to turn them over without your knowledge or consent. The 4 walls of protection include “Company Protection, Encryption Protection, Legal Protection, and Technology Protection.” </p> <h6 class='font-weight-bold'>Why does it matter?</h6> <p> Excellent encryption is pointless if your email provider hands over your sensitive data and username/password to all corporations, political interests and governments that request your data. At CTemplar, we are the only email service provider that offer wall to wall protection without gaps. The strongest fortress in the world is not secure if a wall is missing or gate wide open. </p> <h6 class='font-weight-bold'>Unmatched service for your peace of mind</h6> <p> We lead the industry by providing maximum protection for our users. People desiring the highest level of protection should not buy discount services that merely give the illusion of security. Your privacy is your fortress, you want the walls to be thick and impenetrable to even the strongest attacks. </p>"
