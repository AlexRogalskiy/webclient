# CTemplar

Official Angular cross-platform client for the CTemplar secure email service.

## Prerequisites

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

* Node (`v6.9.0` or higher)
* npm (`v3.0` or higher)
* Angular CLI
  ```
  npm install -g @angular/cli@1.7.3
  ```

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Usage

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Security

CTemplar uses [bcrypt.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js) and [OpenPGP.js](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs) for hashing and encryption.

### Hash Password

CTemplar hashes every password before sending it to server for authentication or sign-up purposes.
A unique salt is created from user's Username which is then used to hash the password using `bcrypt.hashSync(password, salt)` method.

### Encryption

CTemplar encrypts and decrypts contents of every email using user's public/private key pair which is generated during sign up process.

* Public/Private Key pair is generated by `openpgp.generateKey` method using user's plain password as `passphrase`.
  ```
  const options = {
    userIds: [{ name: username, email: 'username@ctemplar.com' }],
    numbits: 4096,
    passphrase: password
  };
  openpgp.generateKey(options);
  ```
* Mail contents are encrypted by `openpgp.encrypt` method using receiver's Public Key.
  ```
  const options = {
      data: content,
      publicKeys: openpgp.key.readArmored(publicKey).keys[0])
  };
  openpgp.encrypt(options);
  ```
* Mail contents are decrypted by `openpgp.decrypt` method using user's Private Key.
  ```
  let decryptedPrivateKey = openpgp.key.readArmored(privateKey).keys[0];
  decryptedPrivateKey.decrypt(passphrase);

  const options = {
      message: openpgp.message.readArmored(encryptedContent),
      privateKeys: [decryptedPrivateKey]
  };
  openpgp.decrypt(options);
  ```
